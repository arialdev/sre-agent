# sre-agent

Proof of Concept for a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) SRE agent, developed as a Master's Thesis in Artificial Intelligence (Alfonso X el Sabio University).

The system ingests SRE runbooks in Markdown format, splits them into semantically coherent chunks, generates embeddings with OpenAI, and stores them in a vector database (ChromaDB). Given an error or log input, it retrieves the most relevant runbook context to assist in incident diagnosis and resolution.

## Prerequisites

- [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) (or Conda)
- An **OpenAI** API key with access to the `text-embedding-3-small` model

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:arialdev/sre-agent.git
cd sre-agent

# 2. Create the environment
mamba env create -f environment.yml

# 3. Activate the environment
mamba activate sre-agent
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

> **Note:** The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` and will never be pushed to the repository.

## Usage

### 1. Ingest the runbooks

Loads runbooks from `data/`, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and persists them to `vectorstore/`:

```bash
python -m src.ingest
```

Expected output:

```
Loaded 3 documents, split into N chunks.
Vectorstore persisted to /path/to/project/vectorstore
```

### 2. Query the vectorstore

Pass an error or log line as an argument and the system returns the most relevant runbook excerpts:

```bash
python -m src.query "ECONNREFUSED error on port 5432 in production logs"
```

If no argument is provided, a default example query is used.
